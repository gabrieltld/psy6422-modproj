# Module Project - PSY6422

I am using data from NHS digital about autism referral numbers, types and waiting times from April 2019 to June 2022 in England. I am planning to look at the the metric ASD12, this metric describes the number of new referrals, per month, for an autism assessment. I am also looking at the breakdown of these referral numbers by age, which is listed separately for each participating NHS practice centre and is separated into discrete categories.

The dataset comes from a larger dataset that is also from the NHS: the Mental Health Services Dataset. Data submissions by services are made for each patient whose care is funded fully or partially by the NHS and data submission is optional for services with patients who are not funded by the NHS.

The data I am using comes from two separate, overlapping, datasets available at: 
https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/autism-statistics/april-2019-to-december-2021 
https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/autism-statistics/july-2021-to-june-2022 
For each time period respectively.

The full codebook can be found on the websites above or on the codebook file on this repository (within "data") along with further information on how data was collected.
