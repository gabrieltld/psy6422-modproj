# Module Project - PSY6422

I am using data from NHS digital about autism referral numbers, types and waiting times from April 2019 to June 2022. I am planning to look at the the metric ASD12, this metric describes the number of new referrals, per month, for an autism assessment. I am also looking at the breakdown of these referral numbers by age, which is listed separately for each participating NHS practice centre.

The data I am using comes from two separate, overlapping, datasets available at: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/autism-statistics/april-2019-to-december-2021 https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/autism-statistics/july-2021-to-june-2022 For each time period respectively.

The full codebook can be found on the websites above or on the codebook file on this repository (within "data") along with further information on how data was collected.
