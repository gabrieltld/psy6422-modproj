This data set is quite large and contains many sections I did not use. Nonetheless, the full codebook is here and more information about these specific datasets can 
be found by looking at the website the data was published on:

The text below is taken from NHS digital (https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/mental-health-services-data-set/about) 
to provide context for the data:

"These statistics are based on the information collected from the Mental Health Services Dataset... The Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS) is a patient level, 
output based, secondary uses data set which aims to deliver robust, comprehensive, nationally consistent and comparable person-based information for children, 
young people and adults who are in contact with services for mental health and wellbeing, learning disability, autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions.
All activity relating to patients who receive assessments and treatment from  Mental Health Services  is within the scope of the Mental Health Services Data Set, 
where the patient has, or are thought to have:
A mental health condition and/or, 
A need for support with their mental wellbeing and/or 
A Learning Disability and/or 
Autism, or 
any other neurodevelopmental condition.
For each patient attending a service located in England: 
If the care is wholly funded by the NHS: the data submission for that patient is mandatory. 
If the care is partially funded by the NHS: the data submission for that patient is mandatory. 
If the care is wholly funded by any means that is not NHS: the data submission for that patient  is optional. 
For each patient attending a service located outside England, but commissioned by an English Integrated Care Board or NHS England specialised commissioner, the 
data submission is optional."

There are several columns in this data set, their meaning is detailed below in a column by column format:

REPORTING_PERIOD_START = This is the date at which data began being collected for that row, the first day of each month.

REPORTING_PERIOD_END = This is the date at which data stopped being collected for that row, the last day of each month.

BREAKDOWN = This is a basic descriptor of the data in the PRIMARY_LEVEL column and sometimes the SECONDARY_LEVEL column. The PRIMARY_LEVEL and SECONDARY_LEVEL 
descriptions are separated by a semi-colon (;) when both are specified in the same cell. The variable names that appear are:
[1] "England"                                   "Age Group"                                
[3] "CCG - GP Practice or Residence"            "CCG - GP Practice or Residence; Age Group"

[7] "Provider"                                  "Provider; Age Group"   
England = the geographic region of England
CCG - GP Practice or Residence = the Clinical Commissioning Group that the GP Practice or Residence falls under (each group corresponds to a geographic region)
Ethnicity = self-described ethnicity according to the patient's records
Provider = Groups that manage hospitals or centres such as NHS Foundation Trusts
Gender = self-described gender according to the patient

PRIMARY_LEVEL = variable names are on the left and dsecriptions are on the right
